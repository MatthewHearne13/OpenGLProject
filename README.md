This is the final project for CS 450 Computer Graphics and CS 457 Computer Graphics Shaders at Oregon State University. I used C++ with OpenGL and GLSL. The Starship uses Cube Mapping to create the reflection and refractions. The Earth and Moon have texture mapping as well as lighting to create the shadows from the objects.
